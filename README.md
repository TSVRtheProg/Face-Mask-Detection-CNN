# Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

---

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Face Mask Detection project! This significant approaches use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to properly detect whether persons in photos are wearing face masks. In an era where safety and health are critical, our project intends to contribute to improving public safety by using the potential of deep learning.


## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate model that can classify images into two categories: 'Masked' and 'No Mask'. By achieving high accuracy and reliability, this model can be instrumental in various applications, from monitoring public spaces to ensuring compliance with health guidelines.

## Steps to Perform

  - **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse dataset of images categorized into 'Masked' and 'No Mask' classes.
    
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Perform data augmentation to enhance model generalization and preprocess the images for optimal training.
    
  - **Model Architecture**: Design and implement a deep learning model using CNN with layers optimized for image classification tasks.
    
  - **Training the Model**: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset, carefully tuning hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.
    
  - **Evaluation**: Validate the model's accuracy and fine-tune it to ensure robustness against various image conditions.
    
  - **Deployment**: Deploy the model for real-time face mask detection, integrating it with applications that can benefit from this technology.

## Conclusion

This Face Mask Detection project demonstrates the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks in solving real-world problems. The high accuracy achieved during validation indicates that this model can be reliably used in practical applications, contributing to public health and safety.
